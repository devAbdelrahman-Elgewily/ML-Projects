# ðŸ“° Fake News Detector using Machine Learning

This project implements a **Fake News Detection** system using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques. The goal is to automatically classify news articles as *real* or *fake* based on their content.

## ðŸš€ Project Highlights

- Binary classification of news articles: *Real* vs *Fake*
- Text preprocessing with **TF-IDF Vectorization**
- Classification using multiple ML algorithms:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Passive Aggressive Classifier
- Model evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
